## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Number Classifier

#### Description
Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero using an if-elif-else statement.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Prompt the user to enter a number
- Use if-elif-else to classify the number
- Print the result to the user

### 🛠️ Task 2: Sum of Even Numbers

#### Description
Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 100
- Check if each number is even
- Accumulate and print the sum at the end

### 🛠️ Task 3: List Search with While Loop

#### Description
Given a list of numbers, use a while loop to search for a specific value (e.g., 42). Print whether the value was found and at which index, or print a message if not found.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Use a while loop to iterate through the list
- Check each element for the target value
- Print the index if found, or a message if not found
